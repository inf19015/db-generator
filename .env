# this setting controls the overall type of the installation. The options are:
#     login - allows anonymous access but without logging in they can't save their data sets or generate more than
#             GD_MAX_DEMO_MODE_ROWS at a time.
#     single - there's only ever a single account and that user is logged in by default
#     open - anyone that has access to the URL can use the application anonymously or create an account
#     closed - no-one can access it without logging in first
